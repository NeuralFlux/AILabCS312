- generate all children
1. set or true if dims > 3 (safety)
2. sequentially partition (more later)
3. for each element in array, create and process child
4. add child ptr to children
5. get min h child and mark child

- process child (*parent, *child)
1. add parent ptr to child's parents
2. if child dims <= 3, solved = true, update heuristic to actual
   else or = true, calc heuristic

(more later) 2.1. 2 loops. 1 to make (n-1)*2 children and 1 to assign each child dims, n = num matrices
2.2 each outer loop iter, mark siblings

- AO*
1. add root to marked set. If root is terminal, label root as solved
2. select non-terminal leaf node n of the subtree and generate its children
3. cost-revise(n)

- Cost revise
1. Add <= 3 condition to solve small matrices
